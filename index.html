        <p>When shopping for budget-friendly clothing, finding quality items at a good price is essential. Here’s a quick guide to help you find formal shirts, formal pants, and T-shirts without breaking the bank.
            Formal Shirts
            Formal shirts are a wardrobe staple, perfect for office wear or formal events. To find affordable options, look for stores that offer discounts or seasonal sales. Brands like H&M, Uniqlo, and Zara often have quality shirts under $30, especially during sales. For a more budget-friendly approach, consider shopping at outlet stores or online platforms like Amazon, where you can find shirts priced between $15 and $25. Look for cotton or cotton-blend shirts, as they provide comfort and durability.
            Formal Pants
            When it comes to formal pants, comfort and fit are key. Retailers like Target and Walmart offer a range of formal trousers starting at around $20. These stores often carry their own in-house brands, which can be significantly cheaper than designer labels but still offer good quality. For more options, check out online marketplaces like ASOS or eBay, where you can find deals on new and gently used pants. Look for materials like polyester blends or wool for a professional look that doesn’t wrinkle easily.</p>
            T-Shirts
            T-shirts are versatile and essential for casual wear. Budget-friendly options are widely available in stores like Primark, Old Navy, and Cotton On, where prices can start as low as $5. These stores offer a wide variety of colors and styles, allowing you to stock up without overspending. If you’re shopping online, sites like SHEIN and AliExpress offer incredibly cheap options, often with multi-pack deals that can save you even more.</p>
